PART 4:

Despite their similar names, they function differently. GetWindowText also uses buffers, so If you haven't been following along go to buffers.txt.

GETWINDOWTEXT:

GetWindowText get the caption of a parent window, not of a child window. (If you don't know what I am talking about read API.txt and FINDWINDOW FINDWINDOWex.txt) Yes, it uses buffers, but they are suprisingly easiy.


GetWindowText ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal lpString As String, ByVal cch As Long


Params:

	hWnd:
	
	hWnd refers to the Window Handle of the window you want to get the caption. 

	lpString:

	Oh no, buffer time. Ok, just declare a string and * by 256. This the string that will hold the caption for us.
	
	Dim sCaption as string * 256
	
	cch:

	cch is just the len of the string that you will get, so place 256 there as well :-) Yes, you could use GETWINDOWTEXTLENGTH, but a caption can't exceed 256, so why declare another window api?

EXAMPLE OF GETWINDOWTEXT:
	
	Dim lNotepadhWnd as long
	Dim sCaption as string * 256

	lNotepadhWnd = FindWindow("Notepad",vbnullstring)

	GetWindowText lNotepadHwnd, sCaption, 256

	MSGBOX scaption

//
	


SETWINDOWTEXT:

Sets the caption of a parent hwnd. Very easy to use.

SetWindowText ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal lpString As String

PARAMS:

	hwnd:
	
	hwnd refers to the window handle of the window you want to change

	lpString:

	lpString refers to the string that you want to use as the new caption

EXAMPLE OF SETWINDOWTEXT:

	Dim lNotepadhWnd as long
	Dim sNotepadText as string

	lNotepadhWnd = FindWindow("Notepad",vbnullstring)	

	sNotepadText = inputbox("What do you want the caption to say?")	

	SETWINDOWTEXT lNotepadhwnd,sNotepadText


This is all pretty easy. If you are having trouble, see the example code for acutal usage!
